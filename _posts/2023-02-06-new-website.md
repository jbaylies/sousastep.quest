I'm moving my website off of Wix and onto Github Pages. I ditched sousastep.com and bought sousastep.quest from Porkbun for about a dollar. Later, I'll transfer the domain from Porkbun to Cloudflare for the low renewal fees. This website is basically a fork of [poole/lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). It took me a while to figure out how to get Jekyll set up on my m1 mac, configure the gh-pages branch properly, and assign the custom URL, but with that out of the way the workflow is smoooooth
