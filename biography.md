John Baylies is a freelance tuba player and audio technician known for his experiments in electroacoustic improvisation. A native of North Andover, Massachusetts, John currently lives in New York City where he leads his band [Sousastep](https://www.youtube.com/@sousastep), and performs in a handful of ensembles such as the [Dingonek Street Band](https://www.dingonekbrass.com/), and [Sunnyside Electric](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1bx2iY7qBgQBiQmYCHRi1U/discography).

John graduated with a bachelors in brass performance from Boston University in 2014 and promptly began busking, which led to regular performances with the [Hot Tamale Brass Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNMEuwx758) and other ensembles. That year, John became inspired by the Dubstep Allstars mixes and began figuring out how to play dubstep on tuba. He used [Controllermate](https://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/) to control Ableton Live with a Playstation controller, and developed [his first effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0IExQclhTE) by the end of that year. He prototyped his rig regularly with free improvisation ensembles, mostly under the umbrella of [Evil Clown Records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zef4LzKkBhg).

At one parade in Boston, John met experimental jazz trumpeter [Eric Dahlman](http://rippedecho.com/), who introduced him to instrument repairman/inventer [Erik Nugent](https://www.instagram.com/fluteworksseattle/). In 2016, Erik and John founded [Nu Mouthpieces](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1615538060/nu-mouthpieces-bridge-low-brass-and-didgeridoo-tec), which exhibited at the International Tuba-Euphonium Conference and the International Trombone Festival, and produced ~70 wooden mouthpieces that facilitate didgeridoo techniques on low brass instruments.

In 2017, John enrolled in Brooklyn Collegeâ€™s Sonic Arts program. There, he learned Max/MSP, and started programming his own [Low Frequency Oscillator and LED sousaphone bell](https://github.com/jbaylies/sousastep#readme). John is currently working as a freelance tuba player, audio technician, recording engineer, and conference engineer in NYC.
