John graduated with a bachelors in brass performance from Boston University in 2014 and promptly began [busking](../images/subway.png), which led to regular performances with the [Hot Tamale Brass Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNMEuwx758) and other ensembles.

That year, John became inspired by the Dubstep Allstars mixes and began figuring out how to play dubstep on tuba. He used [Controllermate](../images/controllermate.jpg) to control Ableton Live with a Playstation controller, and developed [his first effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0IExQclhTE) by the end of that year. He prototyped his rig regularly with free improvisation ensembles, mostly under the umbrella of [Evil Clown Records](https://www.giantevilclown.com/).
